## Research Interests

My research focuses on optimization methods and machine learning, with a particular emphasis on:

- **Learning to Optimize**: Developing machine learning approaches to improve optimization problem solving
- **LLMs for Optimization**: Investigating how large language models can enhance and solve complex optimization problems
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring RL techniques to sequential decision-making problems (e.g. Combinatorial Optimization)

## Current Projects

I am currently working with Prof. Tianshu Yu at the School of Data Science, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) on several projects related to learning-based optimization methods.

## Skills & Tools

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, MATLAB
- **Optimization Tools**: CVXPY, Gurobi
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
